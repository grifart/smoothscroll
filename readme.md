# grifart/smoothscroll

As smoothscroll functionality is nice and more user-friendly, this library solves these two things which were often repeating in our code:

1. Enables smooth scrolling on all anchors starting with `#` character.
2. Enables smooth scrolling when page is entered with `#` character in URL.
